    <h3>We will need...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lemons</li>
        <li>3 sprigs of flowering oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fennel seeds</li>
        <li>freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>300 g plain flour </li>
        <li>12 whole medium squid , prepared, with tentacles, from sustainable sources</li>
        <li>vegetable oil , for deep-frying</li>
        <li>a small bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>3 heaped tablespoons mayonnaise </li>
        <li>1.5l of water</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons harissa paste</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons rose water</li>
  


    </ul>
    <h3>And with that we are gonna...</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the harissa mayo, peel and bash the garlic in a pestle and mortar with a little sea salt, then muddle in the mayo. Add 2 teaspoons of harissa, followed by the zest and juice from ½ a lemon, then mix well, taste and add a little more lemon juice, if needed. Transfer to a bowl, drizzle over the rosewater and ripple through the remaining harissa. Set aside.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Scrunch the oregano flowers into a liquidiser and discard the stalks, then add the fennel and a teaspoon each of salt and white pepper. Blitz to a fine powder, then place into a large bowl with the flour and stir to combine.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Wash and pat dry the squid, then slice and open out the tubes like a book. Cut a criss-cross pattern onto the surface, then add to the flour along with the tentacles and toss well to coat.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Place a large, deep saucepan over a medium-high heat. Fill three-quarters full with vegetable oil and allow to heat up. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it's about right. Shake off any excess flour from the squid, then use a slotted spoon to carefully lower into the hot oil (you’ll need to do this in batches). Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden, crisp and cooked through. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining squid.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Rinse the parsley sprigs under cold running water, shake off any excess water, then pick the leaves into the flour. Toss to coat, then lower into the hot oil for a few seconds, or until crisp. Transfer to kitchen paper, then slice 1 lemon horizontally into thin discs, dip into the flour and place in the hot oil for around 1 minute, or until crisp.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Scatter the crispy parsley and lemon slices over the squid, then serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing over and harissa mayo for dunking.</li>
        <p></p>
    </ol>
