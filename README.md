# odin-recipes
First HTML Project in the curriculum.
This time i have to make a website that contains several pages with the data of different recipes. 
In this assignament i'll try my best implementing what i've learned about HTML, command promps, git and GitHub.
I do have some neat ideas im about to implement.
